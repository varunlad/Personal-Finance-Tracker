# Personal Finance Tracker Frontend

A modern, theme-aware React app to track daily expenses. Built with a clean component structure, in-memory auth (Login/Signup), and date-based grouping of expenses. Ready to be connected to a Node + MongoDB backend later.

## ✨ Features

- **Theme Toggle**: Light/Dark mode using CSS variables and Context.
- **Auth (UI only)**: In-memory **Login** and **Signup** pages with basic validation.
- **Protected Content**: `ProtectedContainer` gates the app until the user signs in.
- **Daily Expenses**: Add expenses and view them **grouped by date**, with per-day totals.
- **Modular Structure**: App shell orchestrates layout; all UI lives in separate components.
